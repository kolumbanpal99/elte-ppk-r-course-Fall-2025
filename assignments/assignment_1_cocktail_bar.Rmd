# Skills needed to solve this assignment

-   Using R and RStudio, reading data
-   Reporting using RMarkdown
-   Using Git and Github (for submitting the task)
-   Data manipulation (e.g. dplyr, tidyr)
-   String manipulation (e.g. stringr)

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
```

# Background

Your Cuban uncle sets up a cocktail bar in downtown Budapest. He has a secret list of cocktails that he would like to serve in the bar. He asks you to do create a few lists and tables to set up the shop. As your uncle is a secret hipster, he has a dataset on Github that you can use for the task!

Note: There are several different ways to solve these tasks, feel free to come up with your own.

## 1. Read the data

Read the cocktail data set from: <https://github.com/nthun/cocktail-balance> You can also find the codebook there.

```{r}
cocktail_raw <- readr::read_tsv(
  "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nthun/cocktail-balance/master/cocktail_data.tsv")

# Note: Unfortunately some characters cannot be read in the right format (ex. créme de cacao )
```

## 2. Transform the data table and clean the ingredient variable!

The ingredients are currently in a single cell for each cocktail. It would be better to put them in separate rows. Also, the variable should be cleaned of all quantities (e.g. 1/2 oz, 2 dashes, etc.), and the indicator of alcohol content (e.g. 47.3% abv). You will need to use this cleaned table in later tasks.

```{r}
# Make the separator consistent in the ingredients variable (use everywhere <br/>, not <b4/> for example)
# In some cases the separator may appear in the right format, but there is no space before it or after it.

cocktail_raw <- cocktail_raw %>%
  mutate(
    ingredients = ingredients %>%
      str_replace_all("<br\\s*/?>|<b4\\s*/?>", "<br/>") %>% # normalize the separator
      str_replace_all("(?<!\\s)<br/>", " <br/>") %>% # adding space before the separator
      str_replace_all("<br/>(?!\\s)", "<br/> ") # adding space after the separator
  )
 
# Now we can split the ingredients by the separators

cocktail_raw <- cocktail_raw %>%
  mutate(ingredients = str_split(ingredients, "<br/>")) %>%
  unnest(ingredients) %>%
  mutate(ingredients = str_trim(ingredients))

# 2. Delete quantities and alcohol content

# Step 1, delete everything before the text oz, including oz as well

cocktail_raw <- cocktail_raw %>%
  mutate(ingredient_clean_1 = gsub(".*oz", "", ingredients))

# Step 2, delete every bracket, and its content

cocktail_raw <- cocktail_raw %>%
  mutate(ingredient_clean_1 = gsub("\\(.*?\\)", "", ingredient_clean_1))

# Step 3, delete every bsp, drop/drops and dash/dashes and everything before them

cocktail_raw <- cocktail_raw %>%
  mutate(ingredient_clean_1 = gsub(".*bsp", "", ingredient_clean_1))

cocktail_raw <- cocktail_raw %>%
  mutate(ingredient_clean_1 = gsub(".*drops", "", ingredient_clean_1)) 

cocktail_raw <- cocktail_raw %>%
  mutate(ingredient_clean_1 = gsub(".*drop", "", ingredient_clean_1))

cocktail_raw <- cocktail_raw %>%
  mutate(ingredient_clean_1 = gsub(".*dashes", "", ingredient_clean_1))

cocktail_raw <- cocktail_raw %>%
  mutate(ingredient_clean_1 = gsub(".*dash", "", ingredient_clean_1))

# When using this method its important to note that first the longer string should be deleted, ex first dashes, after dash, in other case "es" remains in the cell.

```

## 3. All ingredients in alphabetical order

Before opening the bar, you need to find a reliable supplier that has all the ingredients. You need to send a list of all possible ingredients you will need. They don't need the quantities (i.e. how many of these are needed), just the names of the ingredients.

```{r}
# Some people during the recipie-editing work may added the ingredients with capital letter, while others no. Also, in some cases may spaces remaind in the cells, so i make sure to get rid off them.

# Check the list first
list(unique(cocktail_raw$ingredient_clean_1))
# We can see, that having a space before and after certain ingredients makes error, let`s resolve it now.

cocktail_raw <- cocktail_raw %>%
  mutate(ingredient_clean_1 = trimws(ingredient_clean_1))

# Test the results

list(unique(cocktail_raw$ingredient_clean_1))

# We can see that it worked, as the number of ingredients decreased to 62 from 65
# Delete the double spaces too

cocktail_raw <- cocktail_raw %>%
  mutate(ingredient_clean_1 = gsub("\\s+", " ", ingredient_clean_1))

# Check again, in alphabetical order
ingredients_list <- as.list(sort(unique(cocktail_raw$ingredient_clean_1)))
```

## 4. Number of unique ingredients

How many different ingredients you will need?

```{r}
# We can check the length of the unique list to count the different ingredients
length(unique(cocktail_raw$ingredient_clean_1))
```

## 5. What are the top 10 ingredients?

What are the 10 most frequently used ingredients? If there are ties, you can list more than 10.

```{r}
table(cocktail_raw$ingredient_clean_1, sort = TRUE)
```

## 6. Which cocktail(s) has/have the most ingredients?

Count the number of ingredients and filter all the cocktails that has that many.

```{r}

```

## 7. How many ingredients appear in only one cocktail (rare ingredient)?

Count all cocktails with only one ingredient, and

```{r}

```

## 8. Which cocktail has an ingredient that is only used in one cocktail?

```{r}

```

## 9. What are the cocktails without rare ingredients?

```{r}
  
```

## 10. Create a cheat sheet for the bartender!

Create a matrix that shows all cocktail names as rows and all ingredients as columns. When a cocktail requires an ingredient, there should be an "X" in the cell, otherwise, the cell should remain empty. Example:

```{r echo=FALSE}
tribble(~name, ~Lime, ~`White rum`, ~`Cane sugar`, ~`Coca-cola`, ~Mint, ~Soda,
        "Caipirissima", "X", "X", "X", "", "", "",
        "Cuba Libre", "X", "X", "", "X","","",
        "Mojito", "X", "X", "", "", "X", "X") %>% 
    relocate(name, sort(names(.)))
```

```{r}

```

Congrats, the bar is now officially open!
