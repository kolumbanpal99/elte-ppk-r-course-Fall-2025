# Background

Your Cuban uncle sets up a cocktail bar in downtown Budapest. He has a secret list of cocktails that he would like to serve in the bar. He asks you to do create a few lists and tables to set up the shop. As your uncle is a secret hipster, he has a dataset on Github that you can use for the task!

Note: There are several different ways to solve these tasks, feel free to come up with your own.

## 1. Read the data

Read the cocktail data set from: <https://github.com/nthun/cocktail-balance> You can also find the codebook there.

```{r}
cocktail_raw <- readr::read_tsv(
  "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nthun/cocktail-balance/master/cocktail_data.tsv")

# Note: Unfortunately some characters cannot be read in the right format (ex. créme de cacao )
```

## 2. Transform the data table and clean the ingredient variable!

The ingredients are currently in a single cell for each cocktail. It would be better to put them in separate rows. Also, the variable should be cleaned of all quantities (e.g. 1/2 oz, 2 dashes, etc.), and the indicator of alcohol content (e.g. 47.3% abv). You will need to use this cleaned table in later tasks.

```{r}
# Make the separator consistent in the ingredients variable (use everywhere <br/>, not <b4/> for example)
# In some cases the separator may appear in the right format, but there is no space before it or after it.

cocktail_raw <- cocktail_raw %>%
  mutate(
    ingredients = ingredients %>%
      str_replace_all("<br\\s*/?>|<b4\\s*/?>", "<br/>") %>% # normalize the separator
      str_replace_all("(?<!\\s)<br/>", " <br/>") %>% # adding space before the separator
      str_replace_all("<br/>(?!\\s)", "<br/> ") # adding space after the separator
  )
 
# Now we can split the ingredients by the separators

cocktail_raw <- cocktail_raw %>%
  mutate(ingredients = str_split(ingredients, "<br/>")) %>%
  unnest(ingredients) %>%
  mutate(ingredients = str_trim(ingredients))

# 2. Delete quantities and alcohol content

# Step 1, delete everything before the text oz, including oz as well

cocktail_raw <- cocktail_raw %>%
  mutate(ingredient_clean_1 = gsub(".*oz", "", ingredients))

# Step 2, delete every bracket, and its content

cocktail_raw <- cocktail_raw %>%
  mutate(ingredient_clean_1 = gsub("\\(.*?\\)", "", ingredient_clean_1))

# Step 3, delete every bsp, drop/drops and dash/dashes and everything before them

cocktail_raw <- cocktail_raw %>%
  mutate(ingredient_clean_1 = gsub(".*bsp", "", ingredient_clean_1))

cocktail_raw <- cocktail_raw %>%
  mutate(ingredient_clean_1 = gsub(".*drops", "", ingredient_clean_1)) 

cocktail_raw <- cocktail_raw %>%
  mutate(ingredient_clean_1 = gsub(".*drop", "", ingredient_clean_1))

cocktail_raw <- cocktail_raw %>%
  mutate(ingredient_clean_1 = gsub(".*dashes", "", ingredient_clean_1))

cocktail_raw <- cocktail_raw %>%
  mutate(ingredient_clean_1 = gsub(".*dash", "", ingredient_clean_1))

# When using this method its important to note that first the longer string should be deleted, ex first dashes, after dash, in other case "es" remains in the cell.

# The issue with this is whenever we can choose from 2 ingredients it makes one more unique value, but both other are present in the list as unique values
# ex. number 58 is "clarified lime juice or champagne acid"
# So again, we have to make another split by "or"
# Add this to a new data frame, as we achieved the variable cleaning process

cocktail_full <- cocktail_raw %>%
  mutate(unique_ingredients = str_split(ingredient_clean_1, "\\s+or\\s+")) %>%
  unnest(unique_ingredients) %>%
  mutate(unique_ingredients = str_trim(unique_ingredients))
```

## 3. All ingredients in alphabetical order

Before opening the bar, you need to find a reliable supplier that has all the ingredients. You need to send a list of all possible ingredients you will need. They don't need the quantities (i.e. how many of these are needed), just the names of the ingredients.

```{r}
# In some cases may spaces remained in the cells, so i make sure to get rid off them.
cocktail_full <- cocktail_full %>%
  mutate(unique_ingredients = trimws(unique_ingredients))

# Delete the double spaces too
cocktail_full <- cocktail_full %>%
  mutate(unique_ingredients = gsub("\\s+", " ", unique_ingredients))

# Check the ingredients in alphabetical order
all_ingredients_list <- as.list(sort(unique(cocktail_full$unique_ingredients)))

```

## 4. Number of unique ingredients

How many different ingredients you will need?

```{r}
length(all_ingredients_list)
# The coctail_full dataset has 61 different type of cocktail ingredients
```

## 5. What are the top 10 ingredients?

What are the 10 most frequently used ingredients? If there are ties, you can list more than 10.

```{r}
# In case we can choose form 2 ingredients, i consider them as both needed

cocktail_full %>%
  count(unique_ingredients, sort = TRUE) %>%
  slice_max(n, n = 10)
```

## 6. Which cocktail(s) has/have the most ingredients?

Count the number of ingredients and filter all the cocktails that has that many.

```{r}
# First we group by cocktail name, then summarize the unique ingredients and arrange them to check the order

cocktail_full %>%
  group_by(name) %>%
  summarize(n_ingredients = n_distinct(unique_ingredients)) %>%
  arrange(desc(n_ingredients))
```

```{r}
# We can see, that only one has 7, the rest has 6 or less
# Count the maximum number of ingredients and filter for it

cocktail_full %>%
  group_by(name) %>%
  summarize(n_ingredients = n_distinct(unique_ingredients)) %>%
  filter(n_ingredients == max(n_ingredients))
```

## 7. How many ingredients appear in only one cocktail (rare ingredient)?

Count all cocktails with only one ingredient

```{r}
# Probably the instructions above are not complete, but let's check the list

rare_ingredients <- cocktail_full %>%
  distinct(name, unique_ingredients) %>%
  count(unique_ingredients, sort = TRUE) %>%
  filter(n == 1) %>%
  print(n = 30)

rare_list <- as.list(rare_ingredients[[1]])
length(rare_list)

# In the cocktail full dataset we have 26 unique ingredients used in only one cocktail
```

## 8. Which cocktail has an ingredient that is only used in one cocktail?

```{r}
# First we keep every rare ingredient, and attach to them the cocktails

rare_cocktail <- cocktail_full %>%
  semi_join(rare_ingredients, by = "unique_ingredients") %>%
  select(name, unique_ingredients)

# Select the unique cocktails using cocktail specific ingredients 
# (as previously we could see one cocktail could appear multiple times,
# as some cocktails contained multiple rare ingredients

rare_cocktail_list <- as.list(unique(rare_cocktail$name))
length(rare_cocktail_list)

# There is 21 different cocktails having rare ingredient (which is used in one cocktail)
```

## 9. What are the cocktails without rare ingredients?

```{r}
# We can subtract from the total cocktail list those with rare ingredients

full_coctail_list <- as.list(unique(cocktail_full$name))

rare_ingredient_free_cocktails <- setdiff(full_coctail_list, rare_cocktail_list)
print(rare_ingredient_free_cocktails)
# The cocktails which not containing rare ingredients are the following
```

## 10. Create a cheat sheet for the bartender!

Create a matrix that shows all cocktail names as rows and all ingredients as columns. When a cocktail requires an ingredient, there should be an "X" in the cell, otherwise, the cell should remain empty. Example:

```{r echo=FALSE}
tribble(~name, ~Lime, ~`White rum`, ~`Cane sugar`, ~`Coca-cola`, ~Mint, ~Soda,
        "Caipirissima", "X", "X", "X", "", "", "",
        "Cuba Libre", "X", "X", "", "X","","",
        "Mojito", "X", "X", "", "", "X", "X") %>% 
    relocate(name, sort(names(.)))
```

```{r}
# We have a cocktail with mentioning the same ingredient twice, and this made the pivot wider not possible before.
# First we are taking into account every ingredient once/cocktail
cocktail_full <- cocktail_full %>%
  distinct(name, unique_ingredients)

cheat_sheet <- cocktail_full %>%
  mutate(value = "X") %>%                     
  pivot_wider(
    names_from  = unique_ingredients,         
    values_from = value,
    values_fill = list(value = "")
  ) %>%
  relocate(name, sort(names(.)))

knitr::kable(cheat_sheet)
```

Congrats, the bar is now officially open!
