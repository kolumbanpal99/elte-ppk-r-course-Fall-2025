# Skills needed to solve this assignment

-   Using R and RStudio, reading data
-   Reporting using RMarkdown
-   Using Git and Github (for submitting the task)
-   Data manipulation (e.g. dplyr, tidyr)
-   String manipulation (e.g. stringr)

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
```

# Background

Your Cuban uncle sets up a cocktail bar in downtown Budapest. He has a secret list of cocktails that he would like to serve in the bar. He asks you to do create a few lists and tables to set up the shop. As your uncle is a secret hipster, he has a dataset on Github that you can use for the task!

Note: There are several different ways to solve these tasks, feel free to come up with your own.

## 1. Read the data

Read the cocktail data set from: <https://github.com/nthun/cocktail-balance> You can also find the codebook there.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
cocktail_raw <- readr::read_tsv(
  "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nthun/cocktail-balance/master/cocktail_data.tsv")

# Unfortunately. some characters cannot be read in the right format (ex. créme de cacao )
```

## 2. Transform the data table and clean the ingredient variable!

The ingredients are currently in a single cell for each cocktail. It would be better to put them in separate rows. Also, the variable should be cleaned of all quantities (e.g. 1/2 oz, 2 dashes, etc.), and the indicator of alcohol content (e.g. 47.3% abv). You will need to use this cleaned table in later tasks.

```{r}
# Make the separator consistent in the ingredients variable

cocktail_raw <- cocktail_raw %>%
  mutate(
    ingredients = ingredients %>%
      str_replace_all("<br/>|<br>|<b4/>", "<br/>") %>%
      str_replace_all("(?<!\\s)<br/>", " <br/>") %>%
      str_replace_all(">(?!\\s)", "<br/> ")
  )

cocktail_raw <- cocktail_raw %>%
  mutate(ingredients = str_split(ingredients, "<br/> | <br> | <b4/>")) %>%
  unnest(ingredients) %>%
  mutate(ingredients = str_trim(ingredients))

# 2 lines are still not properly splitted, including a case with <br> and <b4/> as well, let`s transform and replace them with proper separator



# Still not good, maybe 

cocktail_raw <- cocktail_raw %>%
  mutate(ingredients = str_split(ingredients, "<br/>")) %>%
  unnest(ingredients) %>%
  mutate(ingredients = str_trim(ingredients))

# Trying new approach to delete quantities

# Step 1, delete everything before the text oz, including oz as well

cocktail_raw <- cocktail_raw %>%
    mutate(ingredient_clean = ingredient %>%
             gsub()

      
```

## 3. All ingredients in alphabetical order

Before opening the bar, you need to find a reliable supplier that has all the ingredients. You need to send a list of all possible ingredients you will need. They don't need the quantities (i.e. how many of these are needed), just the names of the ingredients.

```{r}

```

## 4. Number of unique ingredients

How many different ingredients you will need?

```{r}

```

## 5. What are the top 10 ingredients?

What are the 10 most frequently used ingredients? If there are ties, you can list more than 10.

```{r}

```

## 6. Which cocktail(s) has/have the most ingredients?

Count the number of ingredients and filter all the cocktails that has that many.

```{r}

```

## 7. How many ingredients appear in only one cocktail (rare ingredient)?

Count all cocktails with only one ingredient, and

```{r}

```

## 8. Which cocktail has an ingredient that is only used in one cocktail?

```{r}

```

## 9. What are the cocktails without rare ingredients?

```{r}
  
```

## 10. Create a cheat sheet for the bartender!

Create a matrix that shows all cocktail names as rows and all ingredients as columns. When a cocktail requires an ingredient, there should be an "X" in the cell, otherwise, the cell should remain empty. Example:

```{r echo=FALSE}
tribble(~name, ~Lime, ~`White rum`, ~`Cane sugar`, ~`Coca-cola`, ~Mint, ~Soda,
        "Caipirissima", "X", "X", "X", "", "", "",
        "Cuba Libre", "X", "X", "", "X","","",
        "Mojito", "X", "X", "", "", "X", "X") %>% 
    relocate(name, sort(names(.)))
```

```{r}

```

Congrats, the bar is now officially open!
